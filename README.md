Thanks for checking out my repo! 

This folder contains all the code I used to create my web app, [thresh](https://thresh0.herokuapp.com/).

thresh is an investment analysis dashboard I built to help investors make better investment decisions.
thresh adds value by providing fundamental analysis, and macroeconomic visualizations all in one tidy visualization.

You can read more about what thresh is, and why I built it on my [blog](https://evantheengineer.home.blog/2020/09/21/introducing-my-first-web-app-thresh/)

Here is a quick guide to what you'll find in this repo:
1. **app.py**: Contains thresh itself. Here you'll find the how I connect to the IEXCloud API, how I've structured the dashboard with Plotly Dash, and all my math.
2. **iexcloud_fundamentals.py**: This was what led me to want to create thresh. In this script, I explore how to get financial data from the IEXCloud API.
3. **asset_correlations.py**: This is a beginner analysis that is behind my blog post on [global asset correlations](https://evantheengineer.home.blog/2020/05/29/import-yfinance-as-yf/).
4. **tfsa_analysis.py**: Another very beginner [blog post](https://evantheengineer.home.blog/2020/06/04/portfolio-analysis-in-python/) I wrote as I was starting out in Python.
